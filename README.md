Camera Class (camera.py):

This module provides a Camera class responsible for capturing frames from your webcam using the OpenCV library.
It initializes the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(0), where 0 indicates the default webcam device.
The get_frame() method captures a single frame from the webcam and returns it. If there's an issue capturing the frame, it prints an error message.
The release() method releases the webcam resource when the program finishes.

Face Detector Class (face_detector.py):

This module contains a FaceDetector class that detects faces in the captured frames using the Haar Cascade classifier.
The Haar Cascade classifier is a machine learning-based approach used for object detection. In this case, it's trained to detect faces.
The detect_faces() method takes a frame as input, converts it to grayscale, and then applies the face detection algorithm using cv2.CascadeClassifier.detectMultiScale().
The draw_faces() method draws rectangles around the detected faces on the original frame.

Main Script (main.py):

This is the entry point of the application.
It creates instances of the Camera and FaceDetector classes.
In a loop, it captures frames from the webcam using the get_frame() method of the Camera class.
It then passes each frame to the detect_faces() method of the FaceDetector class to detect faces.
The detected faces are then highlighted by drawing rectangles around them using the draw_faces() method.
The processed frames, with detected faces highlighted, are displayed in a window using cv2.imshow().
The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key, at which point the program releases the webcam resources and closes all windows using camera.release() and cv2.destroyAllWindows().

This project provides a simple demonstration of real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV, making it a good starting point for more complex computer vision applications involving face recognition, tracking, or analysis.
